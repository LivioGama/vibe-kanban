## What is Jujutsu?

[Jujutsu (jj)](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/) is a powerful, next-generation version control system that combines Git-compatibility with advanced features like working-copy-as-a-commit, automatic conflict resolution, and an intuitive interface. Vibe Kanban supports jj as an alternative or complement to Git.

## Why Use Jujutsu?

- **Git-compatible**: Works seamlessly with Git repositories
- **Better UX**: More intuitive commands and workflows
- **Powerful features**: Advanced rebasing, conflict resolution, and branching
- **Non-destructive**: Changes are never lost, easy to undo operations
- **Co-exists with Git**: Can be used alongside Git in the same repository

## Installation

Vibe Kanban will check for jj at startup and display a warning if it's not installed. Follow the instructions below to install Jujutsu on your system.

### macOS

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install jj
```

### Linux

Using Homebrew (Linux):

```bash
brew install jj
```

On Arch Linux:

```bash
pacman -S jj
```

### All Platforms

Using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --locked jj-cli
```

### Binary Downloads

Download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/releases).

## Setup

### Automated Setup

Run the included setup script to check your installation and configure jj:

```bash
node scripts/setup-jj.js
```

This script will:
- Verify jj is installed
- Create a default configuration file
- Guide you through repository initialization

### Manual Setup

#### 1. Configure jj

Create or edit `~/.config/jj/config.toml`:

```toml
# Jujutsu configuration for Vibe Kanban

[user]
name = "Your Name"
email = "your.email@example.com"

[ui]
# Use the default diff tool
diff-editor = "diff"
# Show relative timestamps in logs
relative-timestamps = true
# Enable colored output
color = "auto"

[git]
# Automatically push branches to git remote
push-branch-prefix = ""
# Fetch from all remotes by default
auto-local-branch = true

[revsets]
# Log shows local branches plus main and master
log = "@ | branches() | (main | master)"

[aliases]
# Common shortcuts
st = ["status"]
l = ["log"]
show = ["show"]
```

#### 2. Initialize jj in Your Repository

Navigate to your Git repository and run:

```bash
jj init --git
```

This initializes jj while keeping your existing Git history. The `.jj` directory will be created alongside your `.git` directory.

## Using jj with Vibe Kanban

Once jj is installed and configured, Vibe Kanban will automatically detect it and enable jj-specific features:

### Working with Tasks

When you create tasks in Vibe Kanban with jj-enabled repositories:

- Each task gets its own jj change/commit
- Changes are tracked automatically
- Easy to switch between tasks without stashing
- Conflicts are handled more gracefully

### Common jj Commands

Here are some common jj commands you'll use with Vibe Kanban:

```bash
# View status
jj st

# View log
jj log

# Create a new change
jj new

# Describe the current change
jj describe -m "Your message"

# Squash changes
jj squash

# Rebase
jj rebase -d main

# Push to Git remote
jj git push
```

## Coexisting with Git

Jujutsu can coexist with Git in the same repository. You can continue using Git commands, and jj will stay in sync:

```bash
# Use Git as usual
git commit -m "A commit"
git push

# jj automatically sees Git commits
jj log

# Use jj commands
jj new -m "A new change"

# Sync back to Git
jj git push
```

## Troubleshooting

### jj not found

If Vibe Kanban shows a warning that jj is not installed:

1. Verify jj is in your PATH:
   ```bash
   which jj
   ```

2. If not found, install jj using one of the methods above

3. Restart Vibe Kanban

### Configuration issues

If you encounter configuration issues:

1. Check your config file:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.config/jj/config.toml
   ```

2. Validate the TOML syntax

3. Run the setup script to create a default config:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-jj.js
   ```

### Repository initialization

If you have issues initializing jj:

1. Ensure you're in a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. Initialize jj with Git backend:
   ```bash
   jj init --git
   ```

3. Check for the `.jj` directory:
   ```bash
   ls -la .jj
   ```

## Why jj is Optional

While jj is a powerful tool, Vibe Kanban works perfectly fine with Git alone. The jj integration is optional and adds advanced version control features for users who want them. All core Vibe Kanban features work with standard Git.
